COM-Style interfaces for cross-platform, cross-language.

**This is just a raw WIP-dump for now and will be cleaned up in the future.**

The aim of this project is to provide helper-classes and definitions for binary compatible Microsoft COM-Style interfaces for use with different languages on different platforms, taking advantage of compiler magic as much as possible.

Supported languages so far:
  * C++ via g++ & BCB
  * ObjectPascal via Delphi & FPC
